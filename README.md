# ayu-mirage-contrast

A higher-contrast variant of [Ayu Mirage](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu) for [Zed](https://zed.dev) and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), generated from the upstream Zed theme by a small Python pipeline.

## Layout

```
ayu-mirage.toml                        SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH — hand-edited semantic palette (~45 tokens)
build.py                               orchestrator (runs every target builder)
zed/build.py                           palette → ayu-mirage-high-contrast.json
claude/build.py                        palette → ayu-mirage.json
telegram/build.py                      palette → ayu-mirage.tdesktop-theme (zip)
telegram_ios/build.py                  palette → ayu-mirage.tgios-theme (Telegram iOS)
terminal/build.py                      palette → ayu-mirage.terminal (macOS Terminal.app)
zed/ayu-mirage-high-contrast.json      generated Zed theme
claude/ayu-mirage.json                 generated Claude theme
telegram/ayu-mirage.tdesktop-theme     generated Telegram Desktop theme
telegram_ios/ayu-mirage.tgios-theme    generated Telegram iOS theme
terminal/ayu-mirage.terminal           generated macOS Terminal theme
tools/ayu-source.json                    upstream Zed Ayu (only used by tools/import_from_zed.py)
tools/import_from_zed.py               one-shot pipeline: tools/ayu-source.json → ayu-mirage.toml
Makefile                               convenience targets
```

The model is dead simple now: `ayu-mirage.toml` is the only thing you edit. Every target builder is a pure transformer — it loads the TOML and writes its target file. No pipeline, no upstream JSON, no internal computation. To shift the theme, edit a hex value in the TOML and run `make`.

The contrast pipeline (`GAMMA`, `K_BG`, chrome flatten, accent desat, border darken, …) lives in `tools/import_from_zed.py`. Run `make reseed` only when you want to refresh the palette from a new upstream Ayu snapshot — it overwrites `ayu-mirage.toml`, so review the diff before committing.

To add a new target (Sublime, iTerm, …), drop a `<target>/build.py` next to its sibling outputs (copy `claude/build.py` as a starting point — it's the smallest), and add the directory name to `TARGETS` in the root `build.py`.

## Usage

```sh
make            # build both themes
make install    # copy generated themes into ~/.config/zed/themes and ~/.claude/themes
./install.sh    # same as `make install`, without make
make fetch-source   # refresh tools/ayu-source.json from zed-industries/zed main
```

In Zed: settings → theme → "Ayu Mirage High Contrast".
In Claude Code: `/config` → theme → "Ayu Mirage".
In Telegram Desktop: Settings → Chat Settings → scroll down → "Browse..." next to Custom theme, pick `telegram/ayu-mirage.tdesktop-theme`.
In Telegram iOS: send `telegram_ios/ayu-mirage.tgios-theme` to Saved Messages from any other client (or AirDrop it to your phone), tap the file, then "Apply Theme".
In macOS Terminal: double-click `terminal/ayu-mirage.terminal` (or `open terminal/ayu-mirage.terminal`) — Terminal imports it as a profile. Then Terminal → Settings → Profiles → "Ayu Mirage" → "Default" to make it the default.

## Tuning

Knobs at the top of `tools/import_from_zed.py` (only used during re-seed):

| Knob | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GAMMA` | > 1 brightens midtones (lifts dark backgrounds). |
| `K_BG` | S-curve strength on chrome — stronger means deeper blacks and brighter chrome highs. |
| `K_FG` | S-curve strength on foreground — kept lower so saturated channels don't clamp to 255. |
| `K_DIAG` | S-curve strength on diagnostic tints (`info.background`, `error.background`, …). Gentler than `K_BG` so the dim channel doesn't clip to 0 and oversaturate. |
| `MID` | S-curve midpoint. Lower than 0.5 because the theme is dark-leaning. |
| `BG_SAT` | Chroma kept on chrome backgrounds. 0 = pure neutral gray. |
| `FG_SAT` | Chroma multiplier on foreground/accent colors. |
| `FG_LIGHT` | Lightness multiplier on chromatic foreground. < 1 deepens pastels into vivid; > 1 brightens toward white. |
| `CHROME_TARGET` | RGB component for the mid-gray every chrome value lerps toward. |
| `CHROME_COMPRESS` | How hard chrome lerps toward the target. 0 = preserve original spread; 1 = all chrome becomes the same gray. |

## Pipeline

1. Per-channel: gamma lift, then S-curve around `MID`.
2. Chrome keys (window/panel/editor/terminal backgrounds): desaturate to `BG_SAT`, then lerp toward `CHROME_TARGET` by `CHROME_COMPRESS`. Keeps editor / panels / window chrome reading as one family instead of three different greys.
3. Foreground (text + accents + syntax): saturate first in HSL (so colors don't lose identity to channel clamping), deepen lightness by `FG_LIGHT`, then S-curve.
4. Diagnostic backgrounds (`error.background`, `warning.background`, `created.background`, …): contrast bump only, hue preserved — these tints are signal.

## Claude port

After processing the Zed theme, `build.py` maps its values into Claude Code's custom-theme schema (see `build_claude` for the mapping table). Two manual fixes are baked in:

- `suggestion` ← `warning` so the highlighted row in the slash-command picker is visible.
- `userMessageBackground` ← `element.background` so prompts stand out from the editor background.

## Telegram port

`build_telegram` in `build.py` emits a `.tdesktop-theme` palette (~50 keys covering window chrome, sidebar, chat list, message bubbles, buttons, scrollbar, mentions). Telegram Desktop falls back to its dark defaults for any constant we don't define. Telegram supports `#rrggbbaa`, but every value here is opaque (alpha is stripped on the way out, same as the Claude port).

The output is actually a small zip archive (Telegram still expects the `.tdesktop-theme` extension) containing `colors.tdesktop-theme` plus a solid-color `background.png` matching `windowBg`. That overrides Telegram's default Star Wars chat wallpaper with a flat dark panel. The PNG is generated inline via `zlib` — no Pillow dependency.
